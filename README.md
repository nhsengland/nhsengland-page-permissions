# NHS England page permissions

A WordPress plugin used on the NHS England website to manage edit access to child pages for non-admins.

When installed and activated, the plugin defaults to preventing all non-admins from editing pages. Admins can select users to grant permission to via an interface on top-level pages.

Once a user has been granted permission, they are able to edit the children of that top level page, and add pages as children of that top-level page. They are not able to edit the top-level page itself.
